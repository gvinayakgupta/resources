## Exploring  
Here are a few starter apps that you can explore and learn from:  
- [Basic Apps](https://github.com/google-developer-training/android-fundamentals)  
- [Intermediate Apps](https://github.com/google-developer-training/android-fundamentals-starter-apps-v2)  
- [Advanced Apps](https://github.com/google-developer-training/android-advanced-starter-apps)  

For debugging API calls, Interceptors are very useful. Check out [this](https://github.com/anujkap/APICallsandInterceptor) repo to see how to set it up.

## What Next?  
Android is a constantly changing software, every new release adds a few new features that make things simpler, or remove some things that were possible before so the best thing to do is to go with the flow. 

**Stack Overflow** has a really active community of developers. Use this to your advantage. Any new problem you face might 
have already been solved by someone else there. So, if you face any issues don't be discouraged and just Google it and if there is no solution that you can find, post it on a platform like Stack Overflow and someone will eventually find a solution.  

Checkout [Android Arsnel](https://android-arsenal.com/) for cool tools and frameworks that you can integrate with your apps.

We hope you now know the roadmap to being a professional Native Android Developer :v:

User interface design or user interface engineering is the design of user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus on maximizing usability and the user experience.

## Getting Started :book:
This one course will get you familiar with all tools and tricks related to UI/UX Designing.
- [Complete UI/UX Tutorial](https://youtu.be/68w2VwalD5w)
- [Web Design using Figma](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLERed4ILxkJ0v7VbF-bLnwLj1lz8AansP)

## Done? :disappointed_relieved:
No! You cannot master UI/UX Designing without practice. Practice making different designs for different products (both on mobile and web artboards).

You could also make a portfolio by learning [Frontend Web Dev](../Frontend/WEB.md) or learn [Graphic Designing](./GRAPHIC.md) or [Video Designing](./VIDEO-DESIGN).
